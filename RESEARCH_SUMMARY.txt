KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

MUST DO:
1. Use Restate for durable scanning workflows
2. Implement cryptographic signing for community contributions
3. Build GDPR/CCPA compliance from day one
4. Use SurrealDB's graph + vector capabilities

SHOULD DO:
1. Implement community reputation system
2. Use Kafka for event streaming
3. Implement hybrid (graph + vector) search
4. Use Redis for read caching

CONSIDER:
1. OSS LLMs (Llama, Mistral) for cost sensitivity
2. Multi-region deployment
3. Advanced conflict resolution patterns
4. Predictive threat modeling with ML

AVOID:
1. Synchronous scanning without batching
2. Unencrypted threat data storage
3. Community contributions without verification
4. Manual retry logic (let Restate handle it)

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS
================================================================================

Restate:
- Limitation: Non-deterministic code causes divergence
- Workaround: Wrap all side effects in restate.Run()

SurrealDB:
- Limitation: Write throughput ~5K-10K/sec (single master)
- Workaround: Batch writes, async commits

Network Scanning:
- Limitation: ISP blocking and rate limits
- Workaround: VPN distribution, jitter, slow scanning

Community Model:
- Limitation: Spam and malicious submissions possible
- Workaround: Reputation system, validation pipeline
