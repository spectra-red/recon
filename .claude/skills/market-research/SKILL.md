6. **Cite Everything**: Include URLs for all data points
7. **Look for Recent Data**: Prioritize 2024-2025 data over older reports
8. **Consider Geography**: Global vs regional vs local markets
9. **Validate with Multiple Sources**: Don't rely on a single report
10. **Use WebFetch for Details**: When you find a great source, fetch the full content
