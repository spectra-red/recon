# User Research Skill

This skill enables agents to conduct user research using web search and analysis to understand user needs, behaviors, pain points, and jobs-to-be-done.

## Objective

Research and document user personas, needs, behaviors, pain points, and jobs-to-be-done using web-based resources to inform product requirements.

## Input Required

- **Product/Feature Description**: What is being built
- **Target Market**: Industry, geography, user type
- **Context**: Any known user information

## Research Process

### 1. Identify Target User Segments

**Use WebSearch to research:**
- "[industry] user segments"
- "[product category] customer personas"
- "[market] user demographics"
- "[problem space] who struggles with this"

**Define segments by:**
- Demographics (age, location, company size, role)
- Psychographics (behaviors, attitudes, motivations)
- Technographics (tech savviness, tools used)
- Use patterns (frequency, context, goals)

### 2. Research User Personas

**WebSearch for persona data:**
- "[role] day in the life"
- "[role] responsibilities challenges"
- "[industry] [role] pain points"
- "[persona] goals motivations"

**For each persona, research:**
- **Role & Responsibilities**: What they do day-to-day
- **Goals & Objectives**: What success looks like
- **Challenges & Pain Points**: What frustrates them
- **Tools & Workflows**: What they currently use
- **Decision-making**: How they evaluate solutions
- **Influences**: Who they listen to

### 3. Jobs-to-be-Done Research

**WebSearch for JTBD:**
- "why people use [product category]"
- "[persona] trying to accomplish"
- "[problem] user stories"
- "hire [product] for [job]"

**Research framework:**
- **Functional Job**: What task needs to be done
- **Emotional Job**: How user wants to feel
- **Social Job**: How user wants to be perceived
- **Context**: When/where the job arises
- **Success Criteria**: How user measures success

### 4. Pain Point Research

**WebSearch for pain points:**
- "[problem] complaints"
- "[current solution] frustrations"
- "[persona] struggles with"
- "[industry] challenges 2025"
- "[product category] Reddit complaints"

**Sources:**
- Reddit threads
- Twitter/X discussions
- Product reviews (G2, Capterra, App Store)
- Forum discussions (Stack Overflow, Hacker News)
- Support forums
- LinkedIn posts

**Use WebFetch to analyze:**
- Review sites for common complaints
- Reddit threads for detailed discussions
- Forum threads for problem details

### 5. User Behavior Research

**WebSearch for behavior patterns:**
- "[persona] daily workflow"
- "[industry] work patterns"
- "[product category] user behavior"
- "[persona] decision process"

**Research:**
- Daily workflows and routines
- Tool usage patterns
- Information seeking behavior
- Collaboration patterns
- Decision-making processes
- Adoption triggers

### 6. User Needs Research

**WebSearch for needs:**
- "[persona] needs requirements"
- "[industry] must-have features"
- "[problem] solution requirements"
- "what [persona] wants in [product]"

**Research:**
- **Must-have needs**: Can't live without
- **Nice-to-have needs**: Would make life easier
- **Aspirational needs**: Future desires
- **Unspoken needs**: Not explicitly stated
- **Emergent needs**: Recently surfaced

### 7. Opportunity Scoring Research

**Research importance and satisfaction:**

**Importance research:**
- "[feature] how important"
- "[need] priority for [persona]"
- Survey data on feature importance

**Satisfaction research:**
- "[current solution] satisfaction"
- "[problem] how well solved"
- Review ratings and sentiment

**Opportunity = Importance - Satisfaction**
High importance, low satisfaction = high opportunity

### 8. User Journey Research

**WebSearch for journey insights:**
- "[persona] buying journey"
- "[product category] customer journey"
- "[persona] research process"
- "how [persona] evaluates [product]"

**Map journey stages:**
- **Awareness**: How they discover the problem/solution
- **Consideration**: How they evaluate options
- **Decision**: What triggers purchase/adoption
- **Onboarding**: First-use experience
- **Active Use**: Regular usage patterns
- **Advocacy**: What makes them recommend

### 9. Competitive User Research

**WebSearch for competitor user data:**
- "[competitor] user reviews"
- "[competitor] customer complaints"
- "[competitor] feature requests"
- "why switch from [competitor]"

**Analyze:**
- What users love about competitors
- What users hate about competitors
- Unmet needs in competitive products
- Switching motivations

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize Primary Sources**: Reviews, forums, social media over articles about users
2. **Collect Quotes**: Real user quotes are invaluable
3. **Look for Patterns**: Single complaints matter less than patterns
4. **Segment Carefully**: Different segments have different needs
5. **Focus on Jobs**: Understand what users are trying to accomplish
6. **Quantify When Possible**: How many, how often, how much
7. **Use WebFetch for Depth**: Fetch review pages, Reddit threads for details
8. **Cross-Reference**: Validate findings across multiple sources
9. **Consider Context**: When, where, why the need arises
10. **Identify Unmet Needs**: Gaps in current solutions
