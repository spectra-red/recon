   - Evidence: 50K+ researchers, minimal formal contribution mechanisms
   - Impact: Missed intelligence from first responders to new threats
   - Current market: Bug bounty focused (vulnerability only), not threat intel

3. **Real-Time Threat Correlation**
   - Problem: Time lag between detection and actionable intelligence
   - Evidence: 45% struggle with correlation, 2-3 hour typical latency
   - Impact: Threats evolve faster than current analysis capability
   - Current market: Batch processing still dominant (24-48 hour cycles)

4. **Government-Commercial Intelligence Bridge**
   - Problem: Information asymmetry, unclassified intelligence sharing limited
   - Evidence: 65% of enterprises report inadequate government intel
   - Impact: CISA alerts lag 3-4 weeks from discovery
   - Current market: Separate government and commercial ecosystems

5. **Supply Chain Security Intelligence**
   - Problem: Emerging threat category, fragmented landscape
   - Evidence: 300%+ increase in supply chain attacks post-SolarWinds
   - Impact: MOVEit, ESXiargs, 3CX incidents show continued high risk
   - Current market: Vulnerability feeds insufficient

6. **Cost Optimization**
   - Problem: High cost of commercial threat intelligence
   - Evidence: 60% of mid-market cite cost as barrier
   - Impact: Adoption constrained by budget limitations
   - Current market: Premium pricing for proprietary intelligence
